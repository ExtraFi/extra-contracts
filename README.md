# Extra Finance Contracts

This repository contains the smart contracts source code of Extra Finance. 

As a leveraged farming protocol, our system comprises two components. On one side, there is a lending pool where users can deposit liquidity to earn passive income. On the other side, there is a farming vault where users can borrow liquidity from the lending pool to open leveraged farming positions.
